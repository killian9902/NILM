## NILM Project
* Currently data only from single house (H1)
* 'H1_AI_Dataset' - Preprocessd data

* 'Preprocess_1' - Process data into correct units
* 'Preprocess_2' - Process data into format for AI models (windowing/sequencing)
* 'Visual_Inspection' - Graph plotting to inspect distributions


* MLP BASE - very basic model
* MLP 1 - Includes train/test split & prints output,target randomly in test set
* MLP2 - (CURRNTLY WOKRING) Goal:
  * Inspect gradients
  * Normalisation
  * Initialise parameters?

* LSTM1 - very basic model (NOT WORKING & CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON MLP)
